#SockPairs



Joseph is in the middle of packing for a vacation. He's having a bit of trouble finding all of his socks, though.

Write a function that returns the number of sock pairs he has. A sock pair consists of two of the same letter, such as "AA". The socks are represented as an unordered sequence.

Examples

SockPairs("AA") ➞ 1
SockPairs("ABABC") ➞ 2
SockPairs("CABBACCC") ➞ 4
