# Smooth setence

Carlos is a huge fan of something he calls smooth sentences. A smooth sentence is one where the last letter of each word is identical to the first letter the following word.

To illustrate, the following would be a smooth sentence: "Carlos swam masterfully."

Since "Carlos" ends with an "s" and swam begins with an "s" and swam ends with an "m" and masterfully begins with an "m".

 

The function should return true or false
